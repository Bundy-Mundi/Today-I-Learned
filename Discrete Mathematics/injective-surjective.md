# Injective vs surjective

### Injective (one-to-one)

- For all w in B, there exist at most one w in A such that f(u) = w

- **How to show that f is a injective function**

    - Show if f(a) = f(b) and then a = b

### Surjective (onto)

- For all w in B, there exist u in A such that f(u) = w

- **How to show that f is a surjective function**

    - Compare the Range(f) and the Codomain of f

    - If Range(f) = Codomain of f then f is surjective

    - Professor way: let w in A be arbitrary

    - Then find any contradiction
