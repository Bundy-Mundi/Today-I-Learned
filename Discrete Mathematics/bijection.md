# Bijection

- Also known as `one-to-one correspondence`

- Bijection means injection AND surjection.

### Definition

1. The sets A and B have the same cardinality if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence from A to B. When A and B have the same cardinality, we write `|A| = |B|`

2. If there is a one-to-one function from A to B, the cardinality of A is less than or the same as the cardinality of B and we write `|A| <= |B|`
