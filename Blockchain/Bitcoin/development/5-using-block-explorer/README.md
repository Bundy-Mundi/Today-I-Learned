## Hash

- A `hash` is a cryptographic function with its unique property that it can transform a given input to a fixed number of alphanumeric string and it is part of many cryptographic tools that bitcoin uses to achieve security.

- Hash function is a one-way function, which means there is no way to generate the data if someone has the hash with them. => Meaning even a one-character change in the input data, can completely change the value of the hash output.
