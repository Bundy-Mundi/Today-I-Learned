# 1. Background and Concepts

## Traditional computer system vs Bitcoin network

- CPU is now replaced by a `network of nodes` which does the processing of the input in a defined method.

- The storage media or memory component of a computer is now replaced with a `Ledger` which stores data in a data structure which is a timestamped server of storing records

## Number Formats

- Bitcoin is very much designed in such a way that all of the code is prioritising performance the most. This can be an unfriendly approach to users.

- Therefore, Bitcoin uses a whole set of formats, some similar to assembly level programming directly on a X86 microprocessor if you have a background in that sort of thing.

## Big Numbers

- Bitcoin uses very large numbers (256 bits) for various keys and these numbers require special functions to be able to perform any arithmetic operations on them.

- Pretty much anything involving cryptography uses big numbers and so does Bitcoin.
