# Chain Validation

## 1. Correct block field present

> All fields need to be filled with value.

## 2. Actual 'lastHash' reference

> The lastHash field has to be pointing the previous block's hash

## 3. Valid Hash:

> The hash needs to be generated by using all fields of the block.

## Validation process

1. Regenerate hash from the block with all fields if contains.

2. Compare the 'regenerated-hash' to the block's hash
