# How does blockchain network work?

## P2P network

1. Anyone is allowed to join this network.

2. When someone joins this network, he gets the full copy of the blockchain.

3. The node can use this to verify that everything is still in order.

4. When block is created, each node adds this block to their own chain.

5. The blocks that are tampered with will be rejected by other modes in the network.

    * *tamper: interfere with (something) in order to cause damage or make unauthorized alterations.*

6. To successfully tamper with a blockchain, you will need to tamper with all the blocks on the chain, redo the proof-of-work for each block and take control of more than 50% of the peer-to-peer network. Only then will your tampered block become accepted by everyone else.

7. Smart contract is a small program that is stored in the block.
