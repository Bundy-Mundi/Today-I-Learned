# Proof Of Work

## What is the Proof Of Work system?

- Rather than anyone to freely upload a data, blockchain has users spend computational power(time + electricity) to mine a block.

- In a blockchain network, any peer has capability to submitting a new chain to the system.

- Adding one block is not expensive task, as long as the block is valid, and it is based on the existing valid chain from the genesis block.

- Modifying just one block will entirely change not only its hash, also the whole chain's hashes.

- Proof Of Work system is inspired by Hashcash
