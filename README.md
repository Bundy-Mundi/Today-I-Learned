# Blog activities

## Today I Learned

- I post everything I learn day by day.

- The purpose of this is to try to keep myself motivated and disciplined.

## Rules

- No meaningless commits
- Should be one day one commit
- Every text has to be written in English (for better communication skills in the future)
