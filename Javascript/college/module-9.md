# 9. Node JS

## Background

- Asynchronous programming was in need because it allows the program to send and receive data from and to multiple devices at the same time **without complicated thread management and synchronization.**

- Node JS was developed to make asynchronous programming easier.

## Modules

- When `require()` is called, Node first looks up if there's any exported JS module in the path.

- If Node cannot find any module from the path, then it looks up built-in module or `node_modules` folder.
