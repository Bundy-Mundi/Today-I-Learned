# 8. Asynchronous Programming

## Asynchronicity

- Programs run on top of processors. But for many times, they interact with things outside of the processor. Then we need asynchronous programming.

- An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time.

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

- In a synchronous environment we use multiple threads to do multiple tasks.

## Promises

- A `promise` is an asynchronous action that may complete at some point and produce a value.
