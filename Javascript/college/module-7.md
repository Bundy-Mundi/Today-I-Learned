## Networks and Internet

### Start of the Web

- Web technology has been decentralized from the start, not just technically but also in the way it evolved.

- Many web protocols such as HTTP, are built on top of the Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) connection

### TCP

- A TCP connection works as follows:

    1. One computer must be waiting(listening) for other computers to start talking to it.

    2. To be able to listen for different kinds of communication at the same time on a single machine, each listener has a number(port) associated with it.

    3. Another computer can then establish a connection by connecting to the target machine using the correct port number.

    4. The listening computer is called the server, and the connecting computer is called the client.

### The Web

- The World Wide Web is a set of protocols and formats that allow us to visit web pages in a browser.

- The World Wide Web (not to be confused with the Internet as a whole) is a set of protocols and formats that allow us to visit web pages in a browser.

- Each document on the Web is named by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

### HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)

- Such a script will run as soon as its <script> tag is encountered while the browser reads the HTML.

- A script tag must always be closed with `</script>`, even if it refers to a script file and doesnâ€™t contain any code.
