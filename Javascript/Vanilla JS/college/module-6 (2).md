# Errors

- [Textbook](https://eloquentjavascript.net/08_error.html)

## Strict Mode

- JavaScript can be made a little stricter by enabling strict mode.

- In strict mode, `this` binding holds the value `undefined` in functions that are not called as methods.

- In strict mode, constructors created with the `class` notation will always complain if they are called without `new` keyword.

## Exceptions

- Exceptions are a mechanism that makes it possible for code that runs into a problem to raise (or throw) an exception.

- When the code in the `try` block causes an exception to be raised, the `catch` block is evaluated, with the name in parentheses bound to the exception value.
