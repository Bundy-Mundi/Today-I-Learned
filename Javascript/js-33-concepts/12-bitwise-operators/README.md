# Bitwise Operators, Type Arrays and Array Buffers

## Bitwise Operators

- Understanding bits and bitwise operation will make you a better software developer.

### What are bits?

- Computer uses only binary digits (bits)

- Everything is stored in binary form, then the computer uses encodings such as UTF-8 to map the saved bit combinations to characters.

### Types

- `&` And

- `|` Or

- `~` Not

- `^` Xor

## Type Arrays and Array Buffers
