## DOM

### What is DOM?

- Stands for **Document Object Model**

- It is an essential part of making websites interactive, and JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser.

### How does it work?

- In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model. It looks similar to HTML code, but actually the two are different.

### What is the Difference Between the DOM and HTML Source Code?

- The DOM is modified by client-side JavaScript

- The browser automatically fixes errors in the source code


## Layout Trees

- Notice that under the `HTML`, there are two big sections, `HEAD` and `BODY`
