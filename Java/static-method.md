# Static method inheritance

#### Properties

- Static methods can be inherited.

- Static methods `cannot` be overridden.

- If a static method defined in the superclass is redefined in a subclass, the method defined in the superclass is hidden.


#### Off-topic: overriding vs overloading

- Overriding: Override the instance methods with the same name and same parameters.

- Overloading: Load more functions that have same names but with different parameters.
